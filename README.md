## Notes
- this seems really similar to a modified version of [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Cryptanalysis
- [polyalphabetic substitution cipher](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/polyalpha/polyalpha.html) variant
~~- [Kasiski examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination) is one way to crack type of ciphers (to determine the length of the key)~~
~~- [Kasiski examination implementation](https://github.com/ichantzaras/polysub-cryptanalysis/blob/master/kasiski.py#L39)~~
- Kasiski examination doesn't work because every single time the alpha shifts a different number
- [Index of concidence is used to determine if a text was created using single alphabet or multiple alphabets](https://sites.google.com/site/cryptocrackprogram/user-guide/statistics-tab/index-of-coincidence)

useful tips for troubleshooting your code

use the following regular expression when searching through encrypted text
```
(?<=\D\B)\d+
```

get codewords
```bash
poetry run python -c "print(open('input/codewords.txt').read().strip().split('\n')[1::2])"
```

Run

<!-- - use a [word counter](https://wordcounter.net/character-count) to check if the frequencies from part1 are the same by using the part2 program to crack

Calculate letter frequency, if letter frequency is not expected, eg A, E, and X are the most common letters by a small margin, shift  -->
