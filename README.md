# General Notes
- [polyalphabetic substitution cipher](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/polyalpha/polyalpha.html) variant, it is similar to the [VigenÃ¨re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)

## Things to think about the cipher
- study repetitions and near-repetitions in the ciphertext
- what will happen when a plaintext word is repeated, considering that the codewords shift each time that word is used?
- cipher might even show isomorphic sequences

> The first digit tells you how long the codeword is.
1. This part is huge and you can break up the text into codewords right from the start. 
2. the rest is solved more or less as an [autokey (aka autoclave) cipher key-autokey variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokey_cipher), since the last digit of a codeword gives you the key for the next codeword

Autoclave decryption method without key (pseudocode)
find length of key by testing different keylengths of keyword
for each letter maximaze probability text is plain through frequency analysis

Might be helpful for determine bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams (for frequency analysis)
